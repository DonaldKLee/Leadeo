VidNotes is a free web-based service that allows you to send a link containing a YouTube video alongside notes or instructions or take notes while watching a YouTube video on the side! If you are taking notes on someone else’s device, you can have your notes emailed straight to your inbox to refer back to when you get home!

# How to use:
1. Get the link of any YouTube video of your choice, and paste it into the text box labeled "YouTube Video Link" on the home page
    - If the video exists, it will pop up on the side or top of your screen (Where it pops up depends on the size of your screen)

2. Optional: Add a title for your notes in the text box labeled "Note Title"!

4. Simply play the video from our website, and begin typing your notes in the text box labeled "Note or Instructions" while watching it!

6. When you finish taking your notes, or want to back it up, you can generate a link, and save the link somewhere for later!
    - Don't have anywhere to store it? You can have your link and notes emailed to you!
    - Want the video to automatically play the next time you view your notes? Or want to rick roll your friends? You can enable autoplay by selecting "Yes" under the option that says "Would you like to enable autoplay? (This will not work for all browsers)"

7. Whenever you are ready, you can always go back to that link to view your notes, or duplicate it if you would like to edit

9. Want to share your notes with a friend? Simply send them the link!

Note: Notes will expire after 14 days, however, you can renew notes by duplicating them before they expire!
